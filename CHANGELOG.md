FloatingToolbar is a general purpose toolbar that 

1) Floats (is a row or column in a Material with elevation and the shape of your choice)
2) Displays popup buttons in-line with selected toolbar buttons
3) Can be aligned with any side of the enclosing view

The purpose of FloatingToolbar is to save screen real estate when dealing input options that can overwhelm and run off 
screen easily. By categorizing functions and displaying them only when needed clutter is reduced and 
functional understanding of the interface is increased.

FloatingToolbar includes optional non-popup, standard buttons and a general purpose button tile which displays icons
and optionally labels in a variety of shapes with the option of highlighting.

Usage is meant to be extremely customizable and as simple as possible.
